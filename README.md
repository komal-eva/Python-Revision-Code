# üêç Python Basics Revision

This repository contains my personal revision notebook for Python fundamentals.  
It includes examples and exercises covering:

- Variable declarations and arithmetic operations
- Data types: `int`, `str`, `list`, `tuple`, `dict`
- String manipulation and repetition
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`), `break`, `continue`
- Functions and return values
- Basic error-handling and debugging

The notebook is written and tested in **Google Colab** and is beginner-friendly.
